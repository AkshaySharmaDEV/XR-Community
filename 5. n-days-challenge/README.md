# XR Community: n-days-challenge ðŸŽ¯
This directory will represent the emergence of XR Community in India. In this learning marathon, we challenge you to pose yourself with self-created target and customized checkpoints. Make this directory a time machine for future XR-plorers to revisit your learning journey. We have not made this a 100-days challenge, or a 50-days challenge. Choose your days, personalize your path.

**In the coming days, we will share your n-days-challenge on social media handles.**
