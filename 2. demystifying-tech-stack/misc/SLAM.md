## SLAM Technology

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a technology that allows robots and other autonomous vehicles to build a map of their environment while simultaneously tracking their own location within that map. SLAM is a critical technology for many applications, including self-driving cars, drones, and augmented reality.

There are two main types of SLAM: 
1. Visual SLAM: Visual SLAM uses cameras to track the movement of the vehicle and to identify landmarks in the environment.
2. LiDAR SLAM: LiDAR SLAM uses a laser scanner to create a detailed point cloud of the environment.

## SLAM in XR

XR applications require the ability to track the user's location and orientation in the real world. SLAM can be used to provide this information, which allows XR applications to provide a more immersive and realistic experience.<br><br>

For example, a VR game that uses SLAM can track the user's head movements and adjust the game world accordingly. This allows the user to feel like they are actually inside the game world.<br>
An AR application that uses SLAM can track the user's location and overlay virtual objects onto the real world.

These applications are very simple to comprehend, but are more complex in-depth.
